# Interview Questions

### 7.1 Deck of Cards:
#### Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.
Hints:
```
#153, #275
```

### 7.2 Call Center:
#### Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.

### 7.8 Othello:
#### Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.
Hints:
```
#179, #228

### 7.9 Circular Array:
#### Implement a CircularArray class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard for (Obj 0 : circularArray) notation
