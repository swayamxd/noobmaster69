### 16.10 Living People:
#### Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count.

Hints:
```
#690, #700, #715, #722, #740, #747

### 16.12 XML Encoding:
#### Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:
```xml
Element --> Tag Attributes END Children END
Attribute --> Tag Value
END --> e
Tag --> some predefined mapping to int
Value --> string value
For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a
mapping of family - > 1, person - >2, firstName - > 3, lastName - > 4, state
- > 5).
<family lastName="McDowell" state="CA">
<person firstName="Gayle">Some Message</person>
</family>
Becomes:
1 4 McDowell 5 CA e 2 3 Gayle e Some Message e e
```
#### Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element (passed in Element and Attribute objects).
Hints:
```
#466
```

### 16.13 Bisect Squares:

Hints:
```
#468, #479, #528, #560
```

### 16.14 Best Line:
#### Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.
Hints:
```
#491, #520, #529, #563
```

### 16.15 Master Mind:
#### The Game of Master Mind is played as follows: The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (V), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue). You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB. When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit:' If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit:' Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit. For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit. Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.
Hints:
```
#639, #730
```

### 16.16 Sub Sort:
#### Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest such sequence).
EXAMPLE
```
Input 1, 2, 4, 7, la, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19
Output: (3, 9)
```
Hints:
```
#482, #553, #667, #708, #735, #746
```

### 16.17 Contiguous Sequence:
#### You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.
EXAMPLE
```
Input 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
Output S (Le., {3, -2, 4})
```
Hints:
```
#531, #551, #567, #594, #614
```

### 16.18 Pattern Matching:
#### You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of just the letters a and b, describing a pattern within a string. For example, the string catcatgocatgo matches the pattern aabab (where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b. Write a method to determine if value matches pattern.
Hints:
```
#631, #643, #653, #663, #685, #718, #727
```

### 16.19 Pond Sizes:
#### You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.
EXAMPLE
```
Input:
a 2 1 a
a 1 a 1
1 1 a 1
a 1 a 1
Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)
```
Hints:
```
#674, #687, #706, #723
```

### 16.20 T9: On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of 0 - 4 letters. Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below:
| |  |  |
| ------- |-------| -----|
| 1 | 2<br> abc | 3<br>def |
| 4<br>ghi | 5<br>jkl | 6<br>mno |
| 7<br>pqrs | 8<br>tuv | 9<br>wxyz|
|   |  0   |   |

EXAMPLE
```
Input: 8733
Output: tree, used
```
Hints:
```
#471, #487, #654, #703, #726, #744
```

### 16.21 Sum Swap:
#### Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.
EXAMPLE
```
Input: (4, 1,2, 1, 1, 2) and (3, 6, 3, 3)
Output: (1, 3)
```
Hints:
```
#545, #557, #564, #571, #583, #592, #602, #606, #635
```

### 16.22 Langton's Ant:
#### An ant is sitting on an infinite grid of white and black squares. It initially faces right. At each step, it does the following:
#### (1) At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.
#### (2) At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counter-clockwise). and move forward one unit.
#### Write a program to simulate the first K moves that the ant makes and print the final board as a grid. Note that you are not provided with the data structure to represent the grid. This is something you must design yourself. The only input to your method is K. You should print the final grid and return nothing. The method signature might be something like void printKMoves (int K).
Hints:

### 16.25 LRU Cache:
#### Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item.

When it is full, it should evict the least recently used item.
Hints:
```
